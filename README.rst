Urban Airship Android Push Sample Application
=============================================

This is an example of our `Push Library`_ used in a very basic Android
application. Its full function exists to register with Airmail Control Panel
and to receive and log push notifications. Please see our `full integration
docs`_ for more information.

The main directory is an `Eclipse`_ project and will only work if you have the
`ADT Plugin`_ installed. You can import the directory directly into Eclipse by
issuing the following:

1. File -> Import...
2. Select "Existing Projects into Workspace"
3. Enter the root directory and hit "Finish"

At this point you should have a working copy of this project and be able to
install the project onto your Android device or emulator.

*Note*: Receiving pushes will not work "out-of-the-box". Please see the `full
integration docs`_ for details.
